# QuePi Docs

This repo contains documentation for the QuePi project.

QuePi is a project started by the Electronics Section at The University of Manchester. 

QuePi was developed to provided a base high level embedded platform for development of prototypes to be used in teaching and research.

The QuePi project uses the Raspberry Pi compute module 3 for the embedded processor and Qt as the software framework. Schematic and PCB designs have been created (using Altium Designer), these designs can be used as a starting point for all high level embedded projects; Download the design projects below

* Altium project (CAM1, DISP1, All GPIO, Input Regulation, HDMI, Ethernet, Single USB)
  * X axis expanding design finished
  * Y axis expanding design to follow


* Other configurations to follow

This project as provide up to date compiled Qt binaries for the CM3 which allow you to jump straight into developing the program. The binaries are compressed for storage reasons, free programs such as 7zip etc can uncompressed the binaries stored as tar.gz. These can be downloaded below:

* Qt 5.9, with hardware acceleration << 2nd in queue to be provided
* Qt 5.9, no hardware acceleration << 3rd in queue to be provided
* Qt 5.8, with hardware acceleration  << 1st in queue to be provided
* [Qt 5.8, no hardware acceleration]()

Other binaries can be provided on required, submit a request through the issue manager in GitHub.
